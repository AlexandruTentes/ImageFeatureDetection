# Window display:

windowMode:			complex				# simple = one camera image processing instance (might have a significant performance impact)
								# advanced = two instances, showing more detailed image processing steps
								# complex = four instances, showing most of the image processing steps
displayFrameText:		on				# displays coresponding texts on each of the window mode frames 
								# (has a significant performance impact)


# Config read script:

toggleConfigRuntimeRead:	off				# enable/disable config file read at runtime 
								# (the config file input gets updated each second inside the program)
								# If on, it will be conflicting with the UI implementation

# UI configs:

toggleUI:			on				# enable/disable UI at runtime
								# If on, it will be conflicting with the config runtime script implementation (make sure to disable that first)


# Image processing color boundaries		

	#Team 1
teamOneRGBMin: 			50, 100, 100			# The color that the program will attempt to track for team 1
teamOneRGBMax: 			80, 255, 255

	#Team 2
teamTwoRGBMin: 			200, 200, 0			# The color that the program will attempt to track for team 2
teamTwoRGBMax: 			255, 255, 150


# Image processing display dimensions (the image resolution)

imgWidth:			940				# The display sizes only affect the images displayed (has a massive performance impact)
imgHeight:			500


# Image processing edge detection thresholding dimensions

edgeThresholdMin:		50				# The threshold filters the amount of small/big edges
edgeThresholdMax:		255
edgeBlurKernelSize:		21				# The size of the Gaussian kernel (Ex: a 9 x 9 matrix)
edgeBlurKernelSigma:		11				# The sigma of the kernel (this specifies how thick the radius is)
								# The thickness decides how much the neighbouring pixels matter towords the result

# Image objects detected constraints
	
imgObjectBoxMinWidth:		40				# The object box sizes determin the amount of boxes the program will use to detect color possitions
imgObjectBoxMaxWidth:		-1				# -1 means the program will use hard-coded defaults (in this case, infinite max sizes)
imgObjectBoxMinHeight:		40
imgObjectBoxMaxHeight:		-1
